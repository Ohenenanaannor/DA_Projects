##  What I Do  

### 📌 Data Cleaning & Preparation  
With hands-on experience in **Python, SQL, Excel**, and **Power BI**, I specialize in transforming messy datasets into clean, structured, and analysis-ready formats. I handle missing data, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistent entries using tools like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Excel functions**, ensuring data reliability.

### 📌 Data Visualization & Storytelling  
I create **interactive dashboards** and **clear visual reports** using **Power BI** and **Excel** to make data understandable and engaging. My visualizations are tailored to highlight key trends, KPIs, and actionable insights that support better business decisions.

### 📌 Exploratory & Predictive Analysis  
Using **Python** and its rich libraries like **Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, I explore patterns in data and apply predictive models to forecast outcomes—adding value to both short-term analysis and long-term planning.

### 📌 Reporting & Communication  
I craft detailed, data-driven reports that communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. My goal is to translate complex results into strategies, making insights accessible and impactful across teams.
